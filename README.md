IIR Digital Crossover Audio

A digital crossover can be designed as shown in Figure 8.60. Given audio specifications as:

Sampling rate: 44,100 Hz
Crossover frequency: 1,000 Hz
Highpass filter: third-order Butterworth type at a cutoff frequency of 1,000 Hz
Lowpass filter: third-order Butterworth type at a cutoff frequency of 1,000 Hz,
Use the MATLAB BLT design method to determine:

Frequency responses for the highpass filter and the lowpass filter
Combined frequency response for both filters.
The transfer functions and difference equations for the highpass and lowpass filters
